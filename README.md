# Mini-project-For-PPS(P4)
Mini project for P4 Component.

The following program is for generating a password from the name entered by the user. The concept of the program is that the alternate letters of the name entered by the user will be replaced by the number. The number represents the position of the letter in the alphabet series. For example letter 'k' will be replaced by 11 as 'k' comes at 11th position in the alphabet series. The next step will be printing of the password once the name is encrypted the password  will be printed on the screen. The next will be of decrypting of the password without re entering it. The password will be decrypted and the actual name entered by the user will be printed.

Concepts like multidimensional array looping etc are used in this project.
